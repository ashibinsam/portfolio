            <p class="about">
                An enthusiastic engineer and a creator who aims to create solutions for real world problems using technology. 
                I'm good at algorithmic problem solving and providing solutions real world problems.
            <h2>About my jurney into Engineering!</h2>
            <p class="about">
                I've got passion towards finding and creating new things, asking questions right from my childhood. I've participated in a science competition during my 11th grade. 
                I saw the arduino uno R3 and fell in love with it right away.
                I did have passion for electronics and technology. 
                They came to life once I saw it. 
                I was really happy and got an arduino and a bunch of sensors right away. 
                My first sensor was the ultrasonic sensor, which I used to create a device which can measure our height. 
                From there I went on to create various poject for fun and for some science competitons which had increased my programming skills. 
                I've learnt C++ and Python simultaneously in the school sylabus which helped me a lot in becomming familiar with various languages and some simple algorithms.
                By this time, I've decided to go pursue Engineering.
