                <h2>About my jurney into Engineering!</h2>
                    <p class="about">
                        I've got passion towards finding and creating new things, asking questions right from my childhood. I've participated in a science competition during my 11th grade. 
                        I saw the arduino uno R3 and fell in love with it right away.
                        I did have passion for electronics and technology. 
                        They came to life once I saw it. 
                        I was really happy and got an arduino and a bunch of sensors right away. 
                        My first sensor was the ultrasonic sensor, which I used to create a device which can measure our height. 
                        From there I went on to create various poject for fun and for some science competitons which had increased my programming skills. 
                        I've learnt C++ and Python simultaneously in the school sylabus which helped me a lot in becomming familiar with various languages and some simple algorithms.
                        By this time, I've decided to go pursue Engineering.
